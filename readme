# Bitcoin Trader Behavior Analysis

## What This Project Does
This project analyzes how Bitcoin traders perform during different market emotions (Fear vs Greed). I combined trading data with market sentiment data to find patterns that could help with trading strategies.

## Files Included
- `bitcoin_analysis.ipynb` - Main analysis notebook with all the code
- `trader_data.csv` - Trading data from Hyperliquid exchange (211,224 trades)
- `sentiment_data.csv` - Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index data (1,844 entries)
- `README.md` - This explanation file

## Key Findings
- **Traders make 28x more profit during Greed periods** (53.99 avg vs 1.89 avg PnL)
- **5x more trading happens during Greed** (11,292 vs 2,295 trades)
- **Extreme Fear periods show highest individual profits** (205.82 average PnL)
- **Market sentiment strongly affects trading behavior**

## How to Run This Project
1. Install Python and these libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter

2. Open the notebook:


3. Run all cells to see the analysis and charts

## What I Used
- **Python** for coding
- **Pandas** for data handling
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for charts
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis

## Summary
This analysis shows that market sentiment (Fear/Greed) has a huge impact on how crypto traders behave and perform. During "Greed" periods, traders are much more active and profitable compared to "Fear" periods.

## Assignment Context
This project was completed for a Junior Data Scientist position focusing on crypto trading behavior insights.
